## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-4/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same `Name` as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.
There are 2 `TaskListPanel`, one for All tasks and another for Daily tasks.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `TaskTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommand` and `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the task tracker data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
  the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* contains DeadlineDate, DeadlineTime, ModuleCode, Remark, Status, TaskName, Weightage classes which serve as
  attributes of the Task class
* Tasks stored have to be unique

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPrefs` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the task tracker data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sorting Feature

The proposed sorting feature allows a user to sort the `TaskTracker` according to specified flags. This feature makes use of  `SortingFlag` which indicates the attribute by which `Task`s are to be sorted by. Currently, this feature supports sorting by the following attributes:

1. `dateTime` - Deadline Date & Time (Chronological order)
2. `taskName` - Task Name (Lexicographical order)
3. `moduleCode` - Module Code (Lexicographical order)
4. `priorityTag` - Priority Tag (High -> Medium -> Low)
5. `weightage` - Task weightage (descending order: highest weightage first)

The sorting operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#sortTasks(Comparator)`. The `SortingFlag` determines which type of `Comparator` is to be used for the actual sorting implementation. It is noteworthy to mention that the sorting is performed only on the `UniqueTaskList`  that is displayed on the UI; no actual sorting of JSON data is performed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, and it is assumed that there is existing data in the `TaskTracker`. The user executes the command <br>`sort moduleCode` in order to sort the tasks by module code. The `sort` command creates a new SortingFlag with type `MODULE_CODE`, and creates a `ModuleCodeComparator` to be used for sorting.

Step 2. The `sort` command then calls the `Model#sortTasks(Comparator)`  method, and passes the `ModuleCodeComparator` as a parameter to be used for the sorting.

Step 3. The `Model#sortTasks(Comparator)` method then sorts the `UniqueTaskList`, and the sorted list is then reflected in the UI.

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommand` & `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

### Time-based alerts

The proposed time-based alert allows a user to filter the tasks in `TaskTracker` to have
deadlines within the specified days or weeks. This feature makes use of `DeadlineDateInRangePredicate`
which filter based on the `DeadlineDate` of the task.

The filtering operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate)`.
It is noteworthy to mention that the filtering is performed only on the
`UniqueTaskList`  that is displayed on the UI; no actual filtering of JSON data is performed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filtering mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, and it is assumed that there is existing data in
the `TaskTracker`. The user executes the command <br>`dueIn day/NUMBER_OF_DAYS` in order to filter the
tasks that have `DeadlineDate` within `NUMBER_OF_DAYS` from today. The `dueInCommandParser` creates
a new `DeadlineDateInRangePredicate` with parameter `NUMBER_OF_DAYS` to be used for filtering. The
predicate will be passed on to the `dueIn` command.

Step 2. The `dueIn` command then calls the `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate)`
method, and passes the `DeadlineDateInRangePredicate` as a parameter to be used for the filtering.

Step 3. The `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate)` method then filters the `UniqueTaskList`,
and the filtered list is then reflected in the UI.

![DueInSequenceDiagram](images/DueInSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DueInCommand` & `DueInCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

### Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTaskTracker`. It extends `TaskTracker` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `taskTrackerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTaskTracker#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current task tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedTaskTracker#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous task tracker state from its history.
* `VersionedTaskTracker#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone task tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTaskTracker()`, `Model#undoTaskTracker()` and `Model#redoTaskTracker()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTaskTracker` will be initialized with the initial task tracker state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single task tracker state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th task in the task tracker. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitTaskTracker()`, causing the modified state of the task tracker after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `taskTrackerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted task tracker state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add tn/PE1 â€¦â€‹` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitTaskTracker()`, causing another modified task tracker state to be saved into the `taskTrackerStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTaskTracker()`, so the task tracker state will not be saved into the `taskTrackerStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTaskTracker()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous task tracker state, and restores the task tracker to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial TaskTracker state, then there are no previous TaskTracker states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTaskTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoTaskTracker()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the task tracker to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `taskTrackerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest task tracker state, then there are no undone TaskTracker states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTaskTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>
<br>
Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitTaskTracker()`, `Model#undoTaskTracker()` or `Model#redoTaskTracker()`. Thus, the `taskTrackerStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitTaskTracker()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `taskTrackerStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/PE1 â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* is a CS student in NUS
* has a need to consolidate and manage deadlines for CS-coded module tasks
* prefer desktop apps over other types of apps
* prefers to use CLI over a GUI
* can type fast
* prefers an all-keyboard workflow without needing to use a mouse

**Value proposition**:

- manage upcoming CS assignment deadlines faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
- consolidates all CS-coded module tasks into a single place for a CS student to manage and view easily
- allows a CS student to prioritise his/her time by seeing which task deadlines are more pressing
- the app can also remind a CS student about his/her upcoming deadlines so that he/she does not need to remember everything all at once
- easy CLI operation would entice a CS student to use the app, as he/she probably interacts with CLI on a daily basis while coding/doing CS-coded module tasks

          Expected: A new task will be added to the task list, and will be displayed on the Ui with the priority tag `MEDIUM`, tag `CORE` and notes `IMPORTANT`. Status bar shows success message.
        
        
### Editing a task 

1. Use the command `clear` to empty the task list. 
1. Add dummy tasks to test `edit` feature. 
    1.  Use `add mc/CS3243 n/Project 1 d/15-04-2021 t/10:00 w/10%`
    2.  Use `add mc/CS2105 n/Assignment 2 d/15-06-2021 t/10:00 w/30% pt/URGENT pt/CORE ptag/MEDIUM`
    3.  Use `add mc/CS3240 n/Finals d/12-04-2021 t/16:00 w/20% pt/URGENT ptag/HIGH notes/Must do soon`
    4.  After addition of 3 tasks, there will be a list of tasks on the task list.<br>
          Expected: Task list will display 3 tasks with correct input values.    
1. Use command `list` to show all available tasks.
1. Use command `edit` to change module code and name attribute. 
    1. Use `edit 1 mc/CS1010J n/Finals` to attempt to change the first task on the task list.<br>
        Expected: First task on the task list will be change to module code: CS1010J and name: Finals
1. Use command `edit` to change deadline, time and weightage attribute. 
    1. Use `edit 2 d/18-11-2021 t/21:00 w/25%` to attempt to change the second task on the task list.<br>
        Expected: Second task on the task list will be change to deadline: 18-11-2021, time: 21:00 and weightage: 25%
1. Use command `edit` to change tag, priority tag and remarks attribute.
    1. use `edit 3 pt/CORE ptag/MEDIUM notes/not so soon` to attempt to change the third task on the task list.<br>
        Expected: Third tasks on the task list will be changed to tag: CORE, priority tag: MEDIUM and notes: not so soon.
1. (Addtional) Feel free to test `edit` command on one single attribute (weightage alone etc). Reason for not including it in appendix: We hope to allow the user to go through the guide quickly and therefore truncated the some of the single `edit` commands. 
1. Other incorrect `edit` commands to try: `edit x ...` (where x is large than the list size and ... is any attribute you wish to edit), `edit`, `edit 1 XXXX/YYYY` (where XXXX is any of the mc/, n/, pt/, w/, ptag/ and notes/ that can be edited. YYYY is the input that user wishes to put but is similar to the exisiting input. Eg: `edit 1 mc/CS2103` onto the first task on the task list with module code: CS2103 will throw an error). <br>
    Expected: Error will be thrown.


### Deleting a task

1. Using the existing tasks after the `edit` command to ensure that you have a list of tasks on the tasks list.

1. Deleting a task while all tasks are being shown using command `delete`
   1. Prerequisites: List all task(s) using the `list` command. Have at least 1 task(s) in the list.
   1. Deleting the first task on the task list: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First task is deleted from the task list. Details of the deleted task shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
   1. Attempting to delete a task on index 0: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No task is deleted. Error details shown in the status message.
   1. Other incorrect `delete` commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Error will be thrown.

### Finding a task 

1. Recommended to use the `clear` command at this point to input a new set of diversed tasks to be used for test cases
1. Inputting fresh set of diverse tasks into the task list.
    1.  Use `add mc/CS2103 n/Practical d/11-02-2021 t/08:00 w/10%`
    1.  Use `add mc/CS2105 n/Assignment 1 d/15-06-2021 t/10:00 w/30% pt/URGENT pt/CORE ptag/MEDIUM`
    1.  Use `add mc/CS3240 n/Finals d/16-08-2021 t/16:00 w/20% pt/URGENT ptag/HIGH notes/Must do soon`
    1.  Use `add mc/CS4101 n/Project 1 d/08-07-2021 t/23:00 w/5%`
    1.  Use `add mc/CS1231 n/practical d/13-06-2021 t/12:00 w/40% pt/URGENT pt/NONCORE ptag/MEDIUM`
    1.  Use `add mc/CS1010J n/Finals d/12-09-2021 t/21:00 w/15% pt/CORE ptag/HIGH notes/Must do soon`.<br>
          Expected: 6 newly added tasks into the task list
1. Using `find` command to find a list of similar task
    1. Test case: `find practical`.<br>
        Expected: task list will now show 2 tasks: module code: CS1231 and CS2103
    1. Test case: `find URGENT`
        Expected: task list will now show 3 tasks: module code: CS2131, CS2103, CS3240
    1. Test case: `find must do soon`.<br>
        Expected: task list will now show 2 tasks: module code: CS1010J and CS3240 
    1. Test case: `find`.<br>
        Expected: Error details will be shown in the status message
        
### Sorting a task 

1. Recommended to use the tasks from the previous command `find` to be used here for `sort` command. Following instructions will be based off the tasks provided previously.
1. Use `sort` command to Sort tasks in task list.
    1. Test case: `sort dateTime`.<br>
        Expected: All the tasks on the task list will be sorted accordingly to the dataTime in ascending calendar order.
    1. Test case: `sort moduleCode`.<br>
        Expected: All the tasks on the task list will be sorted accordinngly to ascending lexicographical order.
    1. Test case: `sort priorityTag`.<br>
        Expected: All the tasks on the task list will be sorted in decreasing priority levels (LOW>MEDIUM>HIGH). Highest priority will be shown at the top of the task list.
    1. Test case: `sort weightage`.<br>
        Expected: All the tasks on the task list will be sorted in decreasing weightage order, with the heaviest weightage at the top of the task list.
    1. Test case: `sort taskName`.<br>
        Expected: All the tasks on the task list will be sorted in the lexicographical order.
    1. Invalid test cases to try: `sort datetime`, `sort prioritytag`, `sort`, `sort weight`, `sort weight PriorityTag`.<br>
        Expected: Error will be thrown for all these test cases.
        
### Using command `done`

1. Complete a task on the task list using command `done`.
    1. Prerequisites: List all task(s) using the `list` command. Have at least 1 task(s) in the list. Task status to be tested must not be completed
    1. use command `done INDEX` where index is an Integer that is not longer than the length of the task list.
    1. Test case: `done 1`.<br>
        Expected: The first task on the task list will be marked as done. Ui will reflect this change by checking the box to indicate a done status
    1. Invalid use cases to try: `done`, `done X` (where X is an Integer bigger than the length of the task list), `done 0`, `done Y` (where Y is a negative Integer).<br>
         Expected: Error will be thrown.

### Using command `dueIn`

### Using command `doToday`

### Undo a command

### Redo a command 


## **Appendix: Effort**

Given below are the difficulty level, challenges faced, effort required, and achievements of the project.

### Difficulties 
1. Implementing `Daily task list` feature
    * This feature proved challenging to implement, as it required an additional UniqueTaskList to be added to the TaskTracker, along with the relevant methods required to update it. Furthermore, we needed to take into account the modification of tasks on the All tasks list, and propagate any updates to the dailyTaskList.
2. Implementing the color coded feature for `Priority Tag` feature
    * Despite being a seemingly simple feature, colour coding the priority tags proved to be more complicated than we initially assumed it to be. It required the styleProperty of the priority tag component in the UI to be bound to its State, and to be dynamically updated when the priority tag values were updated by the user. Nonetheless, it was an interesting feature that allowed me to learn how to dynamically bind and generate elements using JavaFX.
3. Implementing `undo` feature
    * It was difficult to implment the functionality where only commands which altered the application could be undone as there was no way to differentiate between state modifying commands and non-state modifying commands. This was overcome by creating a NonModifyingCommand Enum to differentiate between the commands as well as overriding the toString() methods of each Command such that they could be checked against the NonModifyingCommand Enum.
4. Implementing `Priority Tag` feature 
    * It was difficult to implement the priority tag feature as we have to take note of the feature ability to be sorted, to handle that issue. We introduced states as an attribute to the priority tag class, and assign values to each of those states such that it was easier to implement the comparator feature this way. 
5. 4-man team instead of 5-man 
    * While other groups have an additional group member, our team has only 1 group members due to unforseeable reasons. This caused us to be behind from most groups initially. However, we did not let the set back affect us and we actively helped each other in our components, we achieved all the deliverables since the first week of submission for the tP and did not receive any complains from the Professor or the TA. 

### Effort required
1. While the Professor and tutor recommended one meeting per week for all the deliverables for the tP, our team went beyond the recommendation and usually meet up 2-3 times a week with an average of 1.5hrs to 2hrs session each. 
2. During the meeting, we vetted each other's work line by line and recommend the best practice to each other in a professional manner. 
3. We also go beyond our own components and reach out to each other if the other team mate require assistance. 
4. Despite being 1 man down, the team managed to submit all the deliverables since the first version and met all the requirements. 

### Achievements of the Project 
1. Successfully allowed semester.config to be used by CS students (our target group) for planning of their CS coded modules.
2. Allowed up to at least 1000 tasks to be stored in semester.config, with all the features working.
3. Successfully implemented two tasks list - a general tasks list and a daily task list for students to better organise their schedule and workload.
4. Successfully implemented a working Ui that allows CS students to easily organise their tasks.
5. Successfully implemented a sorting feature that can sort tasks according to most of their attributes.
