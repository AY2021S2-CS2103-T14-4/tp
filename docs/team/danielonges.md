##Enhancements implemented

I implemented 

1. Sorting feature according to pre-defined parameters:
   1. Date and time
   2. Module code
   3. Priority tag
   4. Task name
   5. Weightage
2. Daily task list that allows users to add and remove existing tasks into a daily planner
3. Ability to add notes to a task, which allows a user to jot down any quick remarks related to the task
4. Weightage attribute that allows users to capture the percentage weightage of their tasks
5. UI enhancements, such as colour coding priority tags, adding emojis for task status and creating additional headers for `All tasks` and `Daily tasks`

### Enhancement 1: `Sorting Feature`

What it does: This feature allows the user to sort semester.config according to any one of the five specified parameters mentioned above.

Justification: The motivation behind implementing this feature is to allow users to view their tasks in a preferred order, e.g. viewing the assignments that are due the soonest.
